# Get Available Languages Prompt

## Agent Instructions

The AG-UI README.md contains a list of Language SDKs. You are to look at "Programming Languages peoples are learning" and create a list of 4 possible programming languages we could add support for. These need to be programming languages with full support for server sent events when running on the command line. So HTML or CSS are not appropriate languages but something like C++ or Elixir could be. We then want to use the provide_language_options tool to create a report of these.

## Project Information
Read through relevant documentation and create a list of 4 programming languages we could add support for.
